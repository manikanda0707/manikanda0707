	/*public static <T> List<T> asList(T... a)
Returns a fixed-size list backed by the specified array. (Changes to the returned list "write through" to the array.) This method acts as bridge between array-based and collection-based APIs, in combination with Collection.toArray(). The returned list is serializable and implements RandomAccess. 
This method also provides a convenient way to create a fixed-size list initialized to contain several elements: 

     List<String> stooges = Arrays.asList("Larry", "Moe", "Curly");
 
Type Parameters: 
T - the class of the objects in the array 
Parameters: 
a - the array by which the list will be backed 
Returns: 
a list view of the specified array

 *stream
default Stream<E> stream()
Returns a sequential Stream with this collection as its source. 
This method should be overridden when the spliterator() method cannot return a spliterator that is IMMUTABLE, CONCURRENT, or late-binding. (See spliterator() for details.)

Implementation Requirements: 
The default implementation creates a sequential Stream from the collection's Spliterator. 
Returns: 
a sequential Stream over the elements in this collection

1.8 */
